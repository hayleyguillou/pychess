# pychess: a work in progress

This is a fun project for getting more comfortable creating GUIs and interactive games in Python.

Next steps:
- create board
- defining possible moves for pieces
- defining winning conditions/if it is a checkmate
- show possible moves on the board
- timer
- score-keeping
